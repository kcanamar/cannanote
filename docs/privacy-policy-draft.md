# Interim Privacy & Beta Participation Notice – CannaNote (January 2026)

Thank you for your interest in CannaNote, a private wellness journaling app currently in private beta.

While we work with legal experts to finalize our full Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, here's our clear commitment to you during this beta phase:

## 1. Local-First Storage
Your journal entries and personal data are stored locally on your device first (using secure, encrypted on-device storage). Nothing is uploaded to our servers unless you explicitly choose to enable sync.

## 2. Never Share or Sell Your Data
We do not—and will never—sell, share, or monetize your personal data. Period. This is a core promise.

## 3. Opt-In Sync Only
Cloud sync (for backup across devices) is completely optional and off by default. You control it fully and can disable or delete synced data at any time.

## 4. Sensitive Data Handling
We treat wellness journaling as highly sensitive personal information. Access is restricted (via row-level security), encrypted, and limited to only what's needed for the app to function.

## 5. Beta Data Collection
During beta, we collect minimal anonymized usage data (e.g., feature interactions, crash reports) only to improve the app—with your explicit consent during onboarding. No personal journal content is ever collected or viewed.

**Minimal usage data includes:**
- App crashes and error reports
- Feature usage patterns (which buttons are used, not what you enter)
- Performance metrics (load times, sync success rates)

## 6. Beta Participation
This is pre-release software provided "as is" for testing. We appreciate your feedback but offer no guarantees of uptime or features. **Important**: Beta data may be lost during development updates—please export your data regularly.

## 7. Data Export & Deletion
You can export all your data or delete your account at any time. During beta, account deletion removes all associated data within 7 days.

## 8. Age Restriction
This app is intended for adults only (21+ in most jurisdictions where applicable).

## Timeline
Full Privacy Policy and Terms of Service are expected by Q2 2026 and will be published before public launch. By participating in the beta, you acknowledge this interim notice.
