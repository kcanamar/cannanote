## Elevator Pitches

### **30-Second Version**
"CannaNote is your personal cannabis journal and educator. Track what works, learn the science, make better decisions. Built by former dispensary professionals who got tired of watching customers waste money on trial and error."

### **60-Second Version**  
"CannaNote solves the biggest problem in cannabis - consistency. I spent years as a dispensary manager watching patients and customers struggle to find relief because nobody was tracking what actually worked. So I built a digital journal that learns your patterns and teaches you cannabis science in plain language. No marketing hype, just your data and peer-reviewed research helping you make better decisions."

### **2-Minute Version**
"Cannabis is incredibly complex - every decision from growing to consumption affects your experience. But the industry sells simplicity through outdated indica/sativa categories and marketing folklore. I worked in Washington's legal market for years and watched this disconnect daily.

CannaNote bridges that gap. It's your personal cannabis educator and tracker, designed by someone who understands both industry promises and consumer reality. We help you build patterns from your experiences, learn cannabis science without academic jargon, and make confident decisions based on your data - not someone else's sales goals.

Whether you're managing medical conditions with multiple consumption methods or just tired of forgetting which strains help, CannaNote turns expensive trial and error into informed cannabis consumption."
