## Voice & Tone

### **How We Talk**

**We don't sound like:**
- Medical professionals giving clinical advice
- Corporate wellness marketing  
- Cannabis industry hype or stereotypes
- Academic researchers or textbooks
- Know-it-all tech companies

### **Voice Examples**

✅ **Good:**
- "Here's what we know about tracking your patterns..."
- "You deserve to understand what works for your body."
- "A gentle reminder for your well-being and the earth."
- "Your personal cannabis educator and tracking companion."
- "Let's look at your data and see what story it tells."

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Revolutionary cannabis analytics platform"
- "Unlock your endocannabinoid potential" 
- "AI-powered consumption optimization"
- "Clinical-grade wellness insights"
- "Disruptive cannabis technology"

**Avoid:**
- Question headlines ("Are You Getting the Most From Cannabis?")
- Clever wordplay ("Highly Recommended Tracking")
- Industry jargon ("Cannabis Analytics Platform")

### **Body Copy**

**Keep it conversational:**
```
You know the problem. You try a strain, it works great, 
and two weeks later you can't remember what it was called.

CannaNote fixes that. Quick logging, clear patterns, 
better decisions.
```

**Not corporate:**
```
Our proprietary cannabis tracking methodology leverages 
advanced data analytics to optimize your consumption 
experience through comprehensive strain analysis.
```

### **Button Text & CTAs**

✅ **Action-focused:**
- "Start Tracking"
- "Get Early Access"  
- "Log This Session"
- "See My Patterns"

❌ **Generic:**
- "Learn More"
- "Get Started"
- "Sign Up Now"
- "Try It Free"

### **Error Messages & Feedback**

**Be helpful, not blame-y:**

✅ **Good:**
- "Couldn't save that entry. Check your internet connection and try again."
- "That email is already in use. Try logging in instead."

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Error 400: Invalid input parameters"
- "You entered the wrong information"

# Understanding Terpenes in Your Cannabis

Terpenes affect how cannabis feels, beyond just THC/CBD. 
Here's what actually matters for your experience.

Myrcene: Often found in indica strains, may promote relaxation
Limonene: Common in citrusy strains, may boost mood
Pinene: Present in pine-scented strains, may improve focus

Track terpene profiles in your entries to see what works for you.
