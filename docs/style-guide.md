# CannaNote Style Guide

## Brand Identity

### **Who We Are**

CannaNote is your personal Ganjier - a knowledgeable cannabis guide that cuts through industry misinformation and helps you become an educated, independent consumer.

**Brand Promise:** Build your cannabis knowledge so you never have to rely on inconsistent budtender advice again.

### **Brand Personality**

**Educated Guide** - We have Ganjier-level knowledge but speak in real language
**Myth-Buster** - We call out cannabis folklore with peer-reviewed facts
**Consumer Advocate** - We help you navigate a market full of misinformation
**Independence Builder** - We give you tools to make your own informed decisions

## Voice & Tone

### **How We Talk**

**We sound like:** The friend who actually read the research but still talks normal - educated stoner who drops real knowledge casually

**We don't sound like:**
- Academic researchers or medical professionals
- Dispensary marketing hype
- Know-it-all cannabis snobs
- Corporate wellness speak

### **Voice Examples**

✅ **Good:**
- "Forget indica vs sativa - that's old school thinking. Track what actually works for YOU."
- "Don't just ask 'what's good for sleep?' Ask about THC:CBD ratios and who grew it."
- "Same strain name, different grower? Yeah, it's gonna hit different. Here's how to spot quality."
- "Build your own cannabis knowledge so you're not guessing every time you shop."

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Revolutionary terpene-based optimization platform"
- "Unlock your endocannabinoid potential with AI insights"
- "Next-generation cannabis analytics for wellness optimization"
- "Clinical-grade cannabis consumption intelligence"

### **Tone Guidelines**

**Be Educational But Chill**
- Drop knowledge casually, not like a textbook
- Explain the "why" behind advice
- Use real cannabis language, not corporate speak

**Be Real About Industry Problems**
- Call out misinformation when you see it
- Acknowledge that cannabis is complicated
- Don't pretend we have all the answers

**Be Practical**
- Focus on what people can actually do
- Give actionable steps for better purchases
- Help them ask better questions at dispensaries

## Writing Guidelines

### **Headlines & Titles**

**Avoid:**
- Question headlines ("Are You Getting the Most From Cannabis?")
- Clever wordplay ("Highly Recommended Tracking")
- Industry jargon ("Cannabis Analytics Platform")

### **Body Copy**

**Keep it conversational:**
```
You know the problem. You try a strain, it works great, 
and two weeks later you can't remember what it was called.

CannaNote fixes that. Quick logging, clear patterns, 
better decisions.
```

**Not corporate:**
```
Our proprietary cannabis tracking methodology leverages 
advanced data analytics to optimize your consumption 
experience through comprehensive strain analysis.
```

- "See My Patterns"

❌ **Generic:**

### **Error Messages & Feedback**

- "Error 400: Invalid input parameters"

# Understanding Terpenes in Your Cannabis

Terpenes affect how cannabis feels, beyond just THC/CBD. 
Here's what actually matters for your experience.

Myrcene: Often found in indica strains, may promote relaxation
Limonene: Common in citrusy strains, may boost mood
Pinene: Present in pine-scented strains, may improve focus

Track terpene profiles in your entries to see what works for you.

professionals for medical advice.*
