## Origin Story Questions

### 1. The Moment of Realization
**What was the specific moment or experience that made you realize there was a problem with how people buy/use cannabis?** 

*Was it a personal experience at a dispensary, watching friends struggle, or something else entirely? Describe the actual situation.*

**Your Response:**
I have always been involved with cannabis as a teen to present day, and all the time I have consumed so much cannabis and had such amazing experiences that I wished that had a journal that kept track for me. 
The thing that drive my conviction for this application comes from my time as a budtender and later as a dispensary manager with my Washington State Medical Consultant License, I would have guests and patients asking for specific use cases and the time that it would take for me to ask all of the right questions seemed to get in the way of their purchasing experience. Some seeing the need to have a comprehensive conversation others wanting to just have what we have and go on their way. I new that there had to be a better way so I decided to enroll in a Coding Bootcamp General Assembly so that I can develop my own skills to create the product that I desired.
Having worked in the industry I have experienced the want to provide credible information to the public surrounding cannabis and its potential therapies. The issue that I found was that there was so much information and not enough trust, we had no way to lean on information that was changing daily and conflicting with the science. Some sources use the inaccurate indica/sativa narrative when there was already enough information available to educate on terpenes and cannabinoids my colleagues and management at the time had limited experience with selling in that fashion. I was then that I wanted to survey my clientele and see what they would want in an application and what came out of that was the idea for cannanote. So easy my elderly mother can use it and practical enough to help our industry provide and source plant to consumers based on their preferences and needs, not marketing or false hype.

### 2. Your Personal Cannabis Journey
**Before you knew about the Ganjier concept, how were you personally approaching cannabis?** 

*Were you the person asking budtenders for advice, reading online reviews, just trying random stuff? What was your process?*

**Your Response:**
As a budtender I was devouring as much information as I could get my hands on, from youtube channels such as the growers network and from countless medical journals where I would consume the knowledge and use it to aid in my sales and consulting. Talking with as many people in the industry as I can an comparing notes and sharing resources, such as en.seedfinder.eu was a huge win, where I would spend hours on hours learning about genealogy of various strains.

### 3. Discovering the Ganjier Approach
**How did you first encounter the Ganjier certification/approach?** 

*Was it through a person, article, course, or just stumbled across it? What was your initial reaction?*

**Your Response:**
As my wife is a Cicerone and Sommelier, I wanted to learn if there was an equivalent for cannabis. This led me on the journey of acquiring my medical consultant license in WA state. I am actively seeking my Ganjier certification to bring further credibility to the platform, and plan on doing this once I have a working product to show off and further vet with industry professionals.

## Problem Definition Questions

### 4. Industry Frustrations
**What specific industry practices or misinformation frustrated you the most?**

*Think about concrete examples - bad budtender advice, misleading marketing, confusing products, etc.*

**Your Response:**
As a long time cannabis cultivator, distributor when we shifted to regulation we did not come with a solid foundation of what that will look like so instead of a well thought out rollout what we got was a rats nest of conflicting information.
Everything from regulations varying state to state, to inconsistencies in the infrastructure of growing and what are we choosing as "desirable" qualities has changed and mutated this plant far beyond what we knew even 2 years ago. So with all of the new evidence and acknowledgements to the way our product changes in chemical composition every moment of every day and is compounded by environmental factors, heat, humidity, soil, storage, transit, shelf life. My goal is to have a application that can help remove some of the fog of war created by the industry to better educate the consumer with fact and science backed evidence.

### 5. Personal Pain Points
**What were your biggest personal challenges as a cannabis consumer?**

*Consistency issues, wasted money, confusion, anxiety about purchases, etc.*

**Your Response:**
My biggest challenge as a consumer is dialing in my dosage and consumption method to fit my needs. I have to switch between concentrates, vapes, flower, hash, rosin, keif, edibles, topicals so frequently as the tolerance threshold lowers the longer we consume on modality and raises even further without tolerance breaks. I have had the hardest time with know when I can take a break, and when I should be doubling down based on my activity levels.
I know what I know because I worked in this industry for 3 years and I am looking to make that journey a known path for those who follow in my wake.

## Vision Questions

### 6. The "Why" Behind CannaNote
**If you could solve one main problem for cannabis consumers, what would it be?**

*Be specific about the outcome you want to achieve.*

**Your Response:**
Build a cannabis journal that will make my consuming of cannabis frictionless, repeatable and backed by science.
I want to be able to go anywhere in the world that distributes cannabis and have a journal with language to be able to describe what I am looking for as a consumer with as current information as possible. I want notes on my cannabis consumer journey.

### 7. Your Ideal User
**Describe a real person (could be anonymous) who represents your ideal user.**

*Think about someone specific you know or have encountered who would benefit from CannaNote.*

**Your Response:**
I am going to keep the anonymity of this individual, we are going to call them Steve. Steve is a elderly man 50+, who consumed cannabis regularly as a youth and young adult. Recently Steve has developed a condition where his health care team has prescribed Medicinal Cannabis and he wants to track his consumption with more accuracy and efficiency. 
Steve has to manage topical treatments, edible treatments, inhalation treatments, and tinctures with all of the various consumption methods and products it will be challenging for Steve to manage this without a caretaker. Now Steve has a caretaker as required by most medical cannabis qualifiers and this tool would then give aid to them during Steve's journey to wellness.

## Values & Approach Questions

### 9. Core Principles
**What principles guide how you think about cannabis education?**

*What do you believe is important when teaching people about cannabis?*

**Your Response:**
There is no way anything can be repeatable in the current landscape, nothing as each decision in production, harvest, curing, packaging, transit, display, consumption will all impact the "effectiveness" of the plant.
We have to learn that any and all factors that make cannabis unique and approachable are the same factors that make reliable repeatable consumption a true challenge.
Terpenes and Cannabinoids are great markers and can be used intandom with subjective reporting to help guide consumers towards their desired end state.
"You're not wrong" we want to help fill in the gaps left by the underground culture and commercialization of our plant, providing a canary in the coal mine so to speak of how we can stay informed and proactive in recording and monitoring our consumption.

Warm non-judgemental, educational with out the reddit "well askually". This is to add a layer of credibility.

## Future Vision Questions

### 14. Cultural Impact
**What change do you want to see in cannabis culture overall?**

*How do you want the industry or consumer behavior to evolve?*

**Your Response:**
I would like to see the industry evolve into a legal market for the US. Regulated of course as this is a medicine, and those medicinal products need to be behind those barriers to maintain patient/provider confidence that the product being consumed is effective and as controlled as possible.
I want to get the ick out of peoples mouths about cannabis and how it is a recreational AND a medicinal plant, and knowing what the differences are. How can we push the envelop forward in the conversation of this is no different than wine, beer, spirits making as those all come from agriculture, and are processed to give altering states of being.
Cannabis is no different and thus should be treated as such.

**Your Response:**
I was diagnosed 15 years ago with a condition called Sampters Triad, later renamed AERD, and I am now allergic to all NSAIDs making pain, sickness management incredibly difficult as many over the counter products contain my allergies.
I have always want to have a roladex of products or information that I can use to help me source various strains to assist me in my ailments.
I constantly get frustrated when I have to go on the hunt and invest hundreds upon thousands of dollars to find the "needle in the haystack" that provides relief.
In our modern world we should not have to succumb to this outdated way of wellness.
I tried journaling and that was okay when I had my journal with me, I always wanted more and to have it digital always seemed like to correct approach.
