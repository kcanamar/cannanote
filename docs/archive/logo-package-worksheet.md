### Tools for Designing CannaNote Logo & Assets
To emulate the clean, minimalist, tech-forward aesthetic of **terminal.shop** (retro-terminal inspired, monospaced fonts, high-contrast dark modes), **PlanetScale** (modern sans-serif wordmark with subtle gradients/orbits, scalable database vibe), and **monkeytype** (playful yet precise monkey icon with geometric/monospaced typography, dark/light adaptability), I'd use:

- **Primary Tool: Figma** — Collaborative vector design for wordmarks, icons, variations, and prototypes. Excellent for responsive assets, dark mode testing, and exporting all formats.
- **Typography Sources** — Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts for modern geometric sans-serifs (e.g., similar to Inter, Space Grotesk, or monospaced like JetBrains Mono for a terminal nod).
- **Secondary Tools** — Adobe Illustrator for precise vectors if needed; Midjourney or Figma AI plugins for initial concept generation (prompts focused on minimal tech wellness icons).
- **Inspiration Boards** — Mood boards in Figma/Pinterest pulling from these brands: high-contrast, limited palettes, subtle abstractions.

This stack ensures scalable, app-icon-ready assets that feel trustworthy and modern without clichés.

#### 3. Visual Avoid List
**Visual Styles to Avoid:**
- Psychedelic or trippy effects → Doesn't fit: Too recreational/stereotypical, undermines serious wellness focus.
- Overly playful or cartoonish → Doesn't fit: Conflicts with wise, protective personality.
- Busy or ornate designs → Doesn't fit: Overwhelms the calm, minimalist ethos.

**Cannabis Visual Clichés to Avoid:**
- Obvious cannabis leaves → Avoid: Too direct, risks platform restrictions and cliché stigma.
- Neon "stoner" greens/reds/yellows → Avoid: Feels immature, not evidence-based or sophisticated.
- Rastafarian color schemes → Avoid: Culturally insensitive and unrelated to mindful wellness.

#### 4. Name Treatment
**Typography Direction:**
- Clean and modern (geometric sans-serif primary, subtle monospaced influence for tech nod).
- Gentle and approachable (medium weights, rounded terminals where possible).
- Tech-forward with natural balance (avoid overly corporate stiffness).
- One word "CannaNote" (camel case to emphasize "Note" as journaling).

#### 5. Symbol/Icon Direction
**Symbol Approach:**
- ☑ Icon + wordmark (symbol with text)
- ☑ Icon that could work alone (like Apple's apple)

**If you want a symbol, what concepts appeal to you:**
- Abstract notebook/page with subtle data wave/pattern → Represents journaling and insight patterns.
- Minimalist open book or notepad silhouette with geometric lines → Represents personal notes and tracking.
- Subtle node/network connection (like database nodes) → Represents patterns emerging from data.

**Symbol concepts to avoid:**
- Anything leaf-shaped → Doesn't fit: Too literal cannabis reference.
- Smoking devices or plants → Doesn't fit: Promotes consumption over wellness.

#### 6. Cannabis Visual References
**Cannabis Reference Level:**
- ☑ No direct cannabis imagery (focus on data/tracking)

**Reasoning:**
Subtlety avoids app store rejections, stigma, and clichés while emphasizing the journaling/wellness aspect—aligning with evidence-based, harm-reduction values.

#### 7. Data/Science Visual References
**Data/Science References That Could Work:**
- Gentle wave/line chart abstraction → Represents emerging patterns from consumption data.
- Connected dots forming insight shape → Represents scientific pattern recognition.
- Minimal grid or node structure → Represents tracking and personal data points.

**References to Avoid:**
- Literal graphs/bars → Too literal/obvious, feels corporate dashboard.
- Lab equipment/beakers → Doesn't fit the personal, approachable brand.

#### 8. Color Personality
**Color Mood:**
- ☑ Trustworthy and professional
- ☑ Modern and tech-forward
- ☑ Clean and minimal
- ☑ Natural and organic (subtle earthy accents)

#### 9. Color Preferences
**Colors That Feel Right:**
- Deep navy or charcoal → Fits: Trustworthy, calm, tech-professional base.
- Soft sage or muted forest green → Fits: Subtle natural nod without cliché "weed green."
- Clean white/off-white → Fits: Minimal, approachable background.

**Colors to Avoid:**
- Bright lime/neon green → Doesn't work: Cliché cannabis association.
- Red/yellow (Rasta palette) → Doesn't work: Stereotypical and immature.
- Psychedelic multis → Doesn't work: Too recreational.

**Cannabis Color Considerations:**
- Yes, avoid "cannabis green" clichés—opt for sophisticated, desaturated naturals that evoke wellness/earth without direct reference.
