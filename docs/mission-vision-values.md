# CannaNote Mission, Vision & Values

## Mission Statement
**What We Do:**

CannaNote empowers individuals to understand their unique relationship with cannabis by transforming personal consumption data into clear, actionable insights—delivered through a seamless, private, and mindful journaling experience.

*We are a service and hospitality company that makes products in the technology sector.*

## Vision Statement  
**The Future We're Creating:**

A world where every cannabis consumer—starting with ourselves—moves through life with confidence, armed with personal data and scientific understanding to make informed choices that enhance wellness, reduce harm, and support regenerative, sustainable practices.

## Core Values
**How We Operate:**

### **1. Radical Data Transparency**
Users own and fully understand their data. We never hide, sell, or share without explicit, granular consent—no exceptions, no matter the financial incentive.

### **2. User Safety & Harm Reduction First**
Every feature, prompt, and partnership prioritizes well-being over engagement. We build safeguards, educate honestly, and reject anything that could encourage unsafe use.

### **3. Environmental Responsibility**
We minimize digital footprint, champion regenerative cannabis practices, and only align with partners who actively protect the planet.

### **4. Truthful, Evidence-Based Insight**
No hype, no exaggeration. We share only what science and personal data support, fostering genuine understanding over quick wins.

### **5. Inclusive & Equitable Design**
The app works for everyone—regardless of income, location, ability, or background. Accessibility and fairness are built in from day one.

### **6. Kina'ole (Flawless Integrity)**
We do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reason—guided by trust (Covey), infinite-minded resilience (Sinek), and righteous action, even when no one is watching.

## Operational Principles

### **Decision-Making North Star**
When choices are tough, ask in this order:
1. Does this build unbreakable trust?
2. Does this strengthen our long-term resilience in the infinite game?
3. Is this the flawless, righteous path (Kina'ole)?
4. If we're wrong, can we reverse it without lasting harm?
5. What will we learn?

### **Partnership Criteria**
**Work with:** Regenerative growers, evidence-based researchers, harm-reduction advocates, privacy-forward tech companies, inclusive wellness brands prioritizing people and planet over profit.

**Automatic disqualifiers:** Opaque data practices, unsustainable methods, unsubstantiated health claims, pressure to weaken privacy/safety, values that make users or planet less safe.

### **Communication Standards**
Sound like the calm, wise, non-judgmental family member who cares about well-being and the planet. Warm and grounded, never corporate. Honest and straightforward with gentle humor. Empowering without preaching. Phrases like "Here's what we know...", "You deserve to understand...", "A gentle reminder for your well-being and the earth."

### **Team Culture**
Solutions-oriented collaboration. Found a problem? Bring a solution or collaborate to develop one. Essential traits: Courage, Curiosity, Compassion, Collaboration, Competitive spirit. These exist on a spectrum and can be developed through mentorship.

### **Growth Philosophy**
*"Slower growth over compromised values."*

We choose no growth over growth that requires compromising data transparency, user safety, environmental responsibility, evidence-based practices, or inclusive design. Our infinite game prioritizes long-term integrity over short-term gains.
