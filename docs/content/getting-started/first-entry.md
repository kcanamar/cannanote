# Your First Journal Entry

Logging your first session sets the foundation for understanding your cannabis patterns. Here's how to create an accurate, useful entry in under 30 seconds.

## Before You Start

### What You'll Need

- The cannabis product you consumed
- Product packaging (if available)
- A few minutes to reflect on your experience

### Best Practices

- **Log immediately** - Record your session right after consumption for accuracy
- **Be honest** - Include both positive and negative effects
- **Start simple** - You can always add more detail later

## Step-by-Step Entry Process

### 1. Open the Journal

1. Tap the **"+"** button or **"New Entry"**
2. Select **"Cannabis Session"** from the entry types

### 2. Basic Information

#### Date & Time
- **Auto-filled** with current date/time
- **Adjust if needed** for sessions logged later

#### Consumption Method
Choose from:
- **Flower** (smoking, vaporizing)
- **Edibles** (gummies, chocolates, etc.)
- **Concentrates** (dabs, oils, etc.)
- **Topicals** (creams, balms)
- **Other** (custom methods)

#### Amount Consumed
- **Flower**: Weight in grams (e.g., 0.5g)
- **Edibles**: Milligrams of THC (e.g., 10mg)
- **Concentrates**: Small amount descriptions (e.g., "rice grain size")
- **When in doubt**: Use relative terms like "small," "medium," "large"

### 3. Product Details

#### Strain Information
If you know the strain name:
- Enter the **exact name** (e.g., "Blue Dream," "Wedding Cake")
- Select **strain type**: Indica, Sativa, or Hybrid
- Add **THC/CBD percentages** if available on packaging

If you don't know:
- Use **"Unknown Strain"**
- Note any information you have (color, smell, where obtained)

#### Product Source
- **Dispensary name** (if applicable)
- **Street/Friend** (for non-dispensary sources)
- **Homegrown** (if you grew it yourself)

### 4. Effects & Experience

#### Onset Time

- **Smoking/Vaping**: Usually 0-15 minutes
- **Edibles**: 30 minutes to 2 hours
- **Topicals**: 15-45 minutes

#### Duration
How long did the effects last?
- Track the **total duration** from onset to baseline
- Note if effects came in waves

#### Effects Experienced
Select all that apply:
- **Physical**: Relaxed, energetic, hungry, sleepy, pain relief
- **Mental**: Happy, creative, focused, anxious, paranoid, euphoric
- **Medical**: Reduced pain, better sleep, appetite stimulation

#### Intensity Scale
Rate your overall experience (1-10):
- **1-3**: Mild, subtle effects
- **4-6**: Moderate, noticeable effects
- **7-8**: Strong effects, clearly altered state
- **9-10**: Very intense, potentially uncomfortable

### 5. Context & Environment

#### Setting

## After Logging

### Review Your Entry
- **Check for accuracy** - Make sure everything is correct
- **Add forgotten details** - Remember anything else important?
- **Rate satisfaction** - How did this session meet your goals?

### Set Reminders
- **Follow-up check-ins** - How do you feel the next day?
- **Pattern tracking** - Note any recurring effects over time

## Tips for Better Tracking

### Consistency Matters
- **Use the same measurement units** for similar products
- **Log at similar times** when possible
- **Include context** that might affect your experience

### Start Simple, Add Detail Later
- **Basic entries are valuable** - Don't overwhelm yourself
- **Add more fields** as you become comfortable
- **Focus on what matters** to your goals

### Privacy Considerations
- **Use initials** instead of full names for social contexts
- **Be general** about locations if privacy is a concern
- **Remember**: Your data stays on your device unless you choose to sync

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Being Too Vague
❌ "Had some weed, felt good"
✅ "0.5g Blue Dream via vaporizer, felt relaxed and creative for 2 hours"

### Forgetting Context
❌ Just recording the strain and amount
✅ Including mood, setting, purpose, and specific effects

### Not Tracking Negatives
❌ Only recording positive experiences
✅ Noting both positive and negative effects honestly

### Inconsistent Units
❌ Mixing "a bowl," "0.5g," and "small amount"
✅ Sticking to consistent measurements
