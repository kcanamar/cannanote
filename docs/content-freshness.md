## Content Monitoring Workflow

### Step 1: Automated Alerts Setup

**PubMed Alerts:**
- Search terms: "cannabis[Title/Abstract] AND (therapeutic OR medical)"
- Filter by journal list above
- Weekly email digest

**Google Scholar:**
- Journal-specific alerts for each source
- Keyword alerts: "medical cannabis clinical trial"
- Author alerts for key researchers

**Journal RSS Feeds:**
- Set up RSS reader (Feedly) with all journal feeds
- Daily scanning for relevant articles

### Step 2: Content Evaluation Criteria

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- Peer-reviewed research only
- Human studies preferred (animal studies as supporting evidence)
- Clinical relevance to consumer experience
- Reproducible findings

**Priority Topics:**

- Drug interactions and contraindications
- Debunking common myths (indica vs sativa, etc.)

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- Non-peer reviewed opinion pieces
- Industry-funded marketing studies
- Preliminary/non-replicated findings
- Studies with significant methodology flaws

### Step 3: Content Translation Process

**From Research to User Content:**

1. **Identify Key Finding**

   - Feature tip: "Track This: Why [X] Matters"
   - Myth-buster: "Turns Out [Common Belief] Is Wrong"
   - Educational module: "The Real Science Behind [Topic]"

### Step 4: Content Calendar Integration

**Weekly Research Review:**
- Monday: Scan all alerts and feeds
- Tuesday: Evaluate studies for relevance
- Wednesday: Draft content for promising findings
- Thursday: Review and edit content
- Friday: Schedule publication

**Monthly Deep Dives:**
- Choose one significant study per month

## Quality Control Process

### Fact-Checking Protocol
1. **Primary Source Verification**
   - Always link to original study
   - Verify study methodology and sample size
   - Check for peer-review status

2. **Scientific Accuracy Review**
   - Ensure claims match study conclusions
   - Avoid extrapolating beyond research scope
   - Include appropriate caveats and limitations

3. **User Language Check**
   - Maintain Ganjier voice throughout
   - Avoid academic jargon
   - Ensure practical applicability

### Update and Correction Process
