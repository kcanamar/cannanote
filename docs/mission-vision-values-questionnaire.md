## Mission Questions (What You Do)

### 1. Core Purpose
**In one sentence, what is CannaNote's reason for existing?**

*Think about the fundamental problem you solve or need you meet.*

**Your Response:**
For me to have a personal solution to track my cannabis consumption.

---

### 2. Primary Beneficiary  
**Who specifically are you serving? Be as detailed as possible.**

*Beyond "cannabis users" - think demographics, situations, specific needs.*

**Your Response:**
I am serving myself, this what I want and I am going to build to meet my needs, if that helps others bonus.

---

### 3. How You Serve Them
**What specific actions do you take to help these people?**

*Think about your unique approach, not just "we educate" but HOW you educate.*

**Your Response:**
We compile their consumption data into comprehensible patterns of consumption, effectiveness, and frequency to serve as a marker for general wellness.

---

### 4. What Makes You Different
**How is your approach fundamentally different from others trying to solve similar problems?**

*This should reflect your unique methodology or perspective.*

**Your Response:**
I don't care, I don't worry about others as that would take away from what I am doing here. There is enough marketspace to be able to fire users.

---

## Vision Questions (The World You Want to Create)

### 5. Future State for Users
**If CannaNote succeeds completely, how will individual cannabis consumers' lives be different?**

*Paint a picture of a day in the life of your ideal future user.*

**Your Response:**
My ideal future human who frequents our platform, would be a consumer who can go to any dispensary in any state/country and feel confident that they have the vocabulary and scientific facts about their unique consumption patterns to buy with confidence. With a streamline data intake journey capturing every puff, rip, sip, bite, application, dose, etc. being recorded awaiting review and reporting for the human to understand just how much they are consuming to reach their desired state of being. Taking time to note each toke should be as simple as and stress free as breathing.

---

### 6. Industry Impact
**If CannaNote reaches its potential, how will the cannabis industry itself change?**

*Think about ripple effects - how might dispensaries, producers, or other apps adapt?*

**Your Response:**
Consumer reviews led the way for all major markets, as affiliate marketing has a strong hold in current profit margins and currently cannabis has very limited exposure here as promoting consumption is still very taboo. This would flip this on its head as our humans would be able to have influence on the market by opting in to sharing their data with our future partners.
Data is king right now in all sectors, so to predict what the potential could be, we would have to revisit the underwhelming projections for data and how it can be used.

---

### 7. Cultural Shift
**What broader cultural change around cannabis do you want to contribute to?**

*How do you want society's relationship with cannabis to evolve?*

**Your Response:**
Informed Consumers, everyone who wants to enjoy cannabis would benefit from knowing how that substance potentially will reach with them, as there is currently no way to, with out failure, predict a persons reaction to cannabis.

---

### 8. Long-term Legacy
**10 years from now, what do you want people to say CannaNote accomplished?**

*What would make you feel like you truly succeeded?*

**Your Response:**
when I can look back over those years and see my own consumption and how it has changed, and discovering how to bring even more wellness into my life through this beautiful plant.

---

## Values Questions (How You Operate)

### 9. Non-Negotiable Principles
**What principles would you never compromise, even for business success?**

*Think about scenarios where you'd walk away from money to maintain integrity.*

**Your Response:**
Data Transparency, Users deserve to know exactly how their data is collected, used, shared, or stored. I’d walk away from any partnership or revenue stream that required hidden data practices, vague privacy policies, or non-consensual third-party sharing—even if it meant rejecting millions in funding or ad deals.
User Safety and Harm Reduction, Never prioritize growth over features or content that could encourage unsafe cannabis use (e.g., overconsumption or impaired driving). I’d decline investor pressure to optimize for higher engagement metrics at the expense of clear dosage guidance, session limits, or educational safeguards.
Environmental Responsibility, Never support or integrate with suppliers, partners, or practices that knowingly harm the planet (e.g., unsustainable cultivation, excessive water use, or non-recyclable packaging partners). I’d turn down lucrative deals with growers or brands that cut corners on regenerative or eco-friendly methods.
Truthful and Evidence-Based Representation, No exaggerated health claims or misleading efficacy statements. I’d reject marketing language or features that overpromise benefits without solid evidence, even if it boosted conversions significantly.
Inclusive, Non-Discriminatory Design, Never ship features that systematically exclude or disadvantage any group (by income, location, disability, or background). I’d walk away from high-margin opportunities that required compromising accessibility or fairness.

### 10. Decision-Making Guide
**When facing tough business decisions, what questions should you ask yourself?**

*What criteria help you choose between options when there's no clear answer?*

**Your Response:**
A combination of ideas come to mind, Steven Covey's Speed Of Trust 13 trust builders, with Simon Senek's wisdom from the infinite game, and Kina'ole from the hawaiian tradition. 
When options are close analytically, use this hierarchy to break ties:
1. Trust Impact → Which option builds the most trust long-term? (Covey)
1. Infinite Resilience → Which keeps us strongest and most adaptable in the long game? (Sinek)
1. Ethical Flawlessness → Which aligns most closely with doing things perfectly and righteously? (Kina'ole)
1. Reversibility → If we're wrong, which option is easiest to correct without lasting damage?
1. Learning Potential → Which path will teach us the most, even if it fails?

---

### 11. Team Behavior
**How do you want people working on CannaNote to behave? What attitudes or approaches are essential?**

*Think about hiring decisions - what personality traits or work styles are must-haves?*

**Your Response:**
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion above all else. Solutions oriented, found a problem be sure to have a solution or else collaborate with someone to develop a solution. Courage, Curiosity, Compassion, Collaboration, Competitive all traits I would like to have recognizing that they are a spectrum and these traits can be learned and developed with time and mentorship.

---

### 12. User Relationship
**How do you want users to feel about their relationship with CannaNote?**

*Not just "happy" but the specific nature of trust and connection you want to build.*

**Your Response:**
I want our humans to feel like we are in it for them, we are a service, and in part we need to remember that we are a service and hospitality company that makes a product in the technology sector.

---

### 13. Conflict Resolution
**When user needs conflict with business needs, how should those conflicts be resolved?**

*Give a specific example of how this principle would guide a real decision.*

**Your Response:**
The Washington Post Test, ask, "How would this decision or action look if it were reported on the front page of The Washington Post?".
Regulatory "Red Line" Test, ask, "Does this cross any legal/compliance red lines, and how does it affect users?".
Triple Bottom Line (People, Planet, Profit): Evaluate decisions across three pillars: social impact (user needs), environmental sustainability (e.g., eco-friendly cultivation tech), and financial viability.

---

## Practical Application Questions

### 14. Daily Operations
**What does "living your values" look like in day-to-day work?**

*How should these principles show up in product development, customer service, content creation?*

**Your Response:**
Product Development: We default to privacy-first design (e.g., local-first storage, clear consent flows), build harm-reduction tools into every session log (dosage reminders, mood check-ins), and audit features for environmental impact (e.g., minimizing server load, avoiding energy-intensive AI unless necessary). No feature ships without asking, “Does this empower the user without exploiting them or the planet?”
Customer Service: Responses are honest, empathetic, and educational—never defensive or salesy. We admit mistakes quickly, explain data practices plainly, and guide users toward safer, more sustainable choices (e.g., suggesting eco-friendly products when relevant).
Content Creation: All journal prompts, blog posts, and in-app tips are evidence-based, stigma-free, and eco-conscious. We highlight regenerative growers, mindful consumption, and personal insight over hype. Content feels supportive and wise, never promotional or fear-mongering.

---

### 15. Growth Tensions
**As CannaNote grows, what tensions might arise between your principles and business pressure?**

*Think about potential conflicts with investors, partners, or scale requirements.*

**Your Response:**
Investors pushing for aggressive data monetization (e.g., selling anonymized insights to advertisers or researchers) to accelerate growth.
Partners or acquirers demanding looser privacy standards or higher-engagement gamification that could encourage overconsumption.
Scale requirements leading to cheaper, less sustainable infrastructure (e.g., high-energy cloud providers) or partnerships with non-regenerative suppliers for sponsored content.
Pressure to exaggerate health benefits or soften safety warnings to improve retention and appeal to a broader (less mindful) audience.

In each case, we’d choose slower growth—or no growth—over compromise. We’d rather stay small and true than scale at the cost of trust, safety, or the environment.

---

### 16. Communication Style
**How should CannaNote "sound" when communicating? What tone and approach reflect your values?**

*This should connect to your "favorite family member" voice but be more specific about values.*

**Your Response:**
CannaNote should sound like the calm, wise, non-judgmental family member who truly cares about your well-being and the planet. Our tone is:

Warm, approachable, and grounded—never corporate or overly polished.
Honest and straightforward, with gentle humor when appropriate.
Empowering and educational, offering insight without preaching.
Deeply respectful of user privacy and personal choice, while quietly championing sustainability and safety.

We speak as a trusted companion on the journey—curious, supportive, and rooted in integrity. Phrases like “Here’s what we know…”, “You deserve to understand…”, or “A gentle reminder for your well-being and the earth” capture the voice.

---

### 17. Partnership Criteria
**What types of organizations or people would CannaNote work with? What would disqualify a potential partner?**

*How do your values influence business relationship decisions?*

**Your Response:**
Ideal Partners: Regenerative or certified sustainable growers (e.g., Sun+Earth, Clean Green), evidence-based researchers, harm-reduction advocates, privacy-forward tech companies, and inclusive wellness brands that prioritize people and planet over profit.
Disqualifiers (automatic no):
1. Any entity that engages in opaque data practices or non-consensual data sharing.
1. Brands or growers using unsustainable, chemical-heavy, or environmentally damaging methods.
1. Organizations making unsubstantiated health claims or promoting reckless consumption.
1. Partners who pressure us to weaken privacy, safety features, or inclusivity for revenue.
1. Anyone whose values would make our users—or the planet—less safe, less respected, or less empowered.


Partnerships must strengthen trust and align with our infinite game: long-term integrity over short-term gains.
